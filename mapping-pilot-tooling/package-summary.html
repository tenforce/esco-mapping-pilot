<div class="block"><h2>Overview of tools and how to use them</h2>
 <p/>
 We have 4 tools here that do the mapping.
 <p/>
 <ol>
 <li>ExcelParser : takes an excel with translations and outputs rdf</li>
 <li>MappingTool : takes rdf of PES and outputs txt and json file reports</li>
 <li>HtmlReport  : takes json file output of MappingTool and generates nice HTML report</li>
 <li>EscoReport  : takes json file output of MappingTool and generates JSON and HTML report but from ESCO point of view</li>
 </ol>
 <p/>
 Note: for all tools all things are configured with
 <ul>
 <li>root folder: which you need to point to your root folder</li>
 <li>set of configurations: typically same process will happen for each of languages but if you only want to run one
 you can do it without any problem</li>
 </ul>
 <p/>
 <p/>
 <h3>ExcelParser</h3>
 <p/>
 <p>
 First step of process is get excels and process them into RDF. This is exaclty what this tool does.
 Just point to excel translation file in format as reported and it will generate terms for existing concepts.
 </p>
 <p>
 Logic: PT column will be a PT label; both NPT and NPT-NS columns will be NPT labels. Some simple validations will done and
 if they dont pass they will be logged as warnings. Also some splitting based on semi-colon and stripping of gender will happen.
 </p>
 <p>
 <b>Next step</b> now is to actually takes these files and <b>run an ingest</b> with files in a location
 where they will be picked up by ingest process. First copy RDF files in './work/ext/ingest/taxonomy/esco/support' and then
 configure an ingest process in admin tool. Create an ingest profile: 'suggesters' select all, languages select 'en', 'fr',
 'nl', 'es' and 'cs', concept schemes select '*' and views is probably not needed but my config has 'list', 'detail',
 'tree', 'hierarchy' and 'translation'.
 </p>
 <p>
 Pick a file, select correct ingest profile and run the ingest. After that you can run the other tools.
 </p>
 <p/>
 <h3>MappingTool</h3>
 <p/>
 <p>
 Does major work and outputs results as json. Input is a .ttl file which was already created last year based on some output
 of NOCs.
 </p>
 <p>
 Logic: take all concepts in file; for each concept test each term (PT, NPT) with solr database in ESCO; for each ESCO concept
 returned take the highest score (if multiple terms return same concept); sort and save.
 </p>
 <p>
 This JSON output can then be used as input for next 2 tools.
 </p>
 <p/>
 <h3>HtmlReport</h3>
 <p/>
 <p>
 Loads json output of mapping tool and generates a nice report. Per NOC concept.
 </p>
 <p>
 Note: there is a summary but output is hidden for now because they do not want to show it when doing the demo.
 </p>
 <h3>EscoReport</h3>
 <p>
 Loads json output of mapping tool and generates a json and html report. Per ESCO concept.
 </p>
 <p>
 Currently only valid for occupations (not skills) because we filter also on a list of occupation concepts!
 </p>
 <h3>Website</h3>
 <p>
   Currently website is hosted at mapping-pilot.escoportal.eu. Homepage is located at 'resources/index.html'.
 </p>
 <p>
   All generated files should be copied to the server. Main thing to keep in mind there is that each language has its own subfolder
   under the rootfolder of the project.
