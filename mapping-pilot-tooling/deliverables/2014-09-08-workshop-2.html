<h3 id="sec-2-3"><span class="section-number-3">2.3</span> General questions</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-2-3">
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>two very rich systems in the Pilot [French, Dutch]
</li>
<li>ESCO seems to miss task descriptions.
</li>
<li>[!] Rome profile says (in a descriptive way) which certificates are required. BUT it is not formalized. Gerd corrects: they have a very systematic approach to certifications. They have a central database that is linked to the educational system and labour market training. This is included in a structured way into Rome and added information to step-ups to the certificates. All of this information is shared with the educational and labour market training. However, this is a specific database, available on the internet. They are linked together via Rome code.
</li>
<li>Netherlands has something similar: national qualifications database, linked to the occupations. There was a study on this.
</li>
<li>Spain has a similar relationship to vocational training. (relation between occ, qualification and competences)
</li>
<li>France also has links to vocational training in the FPA (continual vocational training) database on qualifications. Note: when FPA defines a training, they need an approval from the national level (quality label)
</li>
<li>Note: PES is not responsible for qualifications
</li>
<li>context: e.g. the job happens in a port, it's a night job, &#x2026; So this can be formally structured (ROME does this using conditions). But in general the context is related to the activities (and how they are implemented in a certain company). Katrien explains that the work context will be added as a new pillar in ESCO. Is this are more formal context, regulsations, labour market systems (night job, weekend), environments (harbour). E.g. kook: has different cuisines as a work context. However, in the moment it is not a structured classifications, just a flat list.
</li>
<li>Czech system does not cover the whole of the labour market (unsure, they are not here). It was developed for a certain subdomain -&gt; this will give a different dimension to the linking with EQF
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-sec-2-4" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-2-4"><span class="section-number-3">2.4</span> Spain</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-2-4">
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>has only occupations because there are other databases in Spain with the other content (SC and Q)
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-sec-2-5" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-2-5"><span class="section-number-3">2.5</span> Occupation vs Job</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-2-5">
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>there is a big difference between occupations and jobs? This will need separate attention. A job is a <b>mix</b> of labour market activities, depending on the company the content of the job is different. So: in the context of mapping, we should be able to map <b>jobs</b> not <b>occupations</b>. 
</li>
<li>for ESCO a job is a set of tasks or responsibilities that is executed by one person in a specific workspace
</li>
<li>occupations are groupings of jobs with similar tasks/responsibilities
</li>
<li>classification system contains things that can be used to describe the contents of the job, but the job will not be part of the classficiation system
</li>
<li>so when doing a mapping, we cannot map the jobs, but we can map the <b>elements</b> that describe the job.
</li>
<li>job come in when we want to assess the quality of the mapping study (to verify that the job can indeed be described after the mapping).
</li>
<li>note: there are also occupations that intersect completely with their job (e.g. dentist)
</li>
<li>if ISCO is a reference between the 28 national classifications, occupations are a good pillar to relate the jobs (jobs might be to fine grained). The occupations have many relations as well, which further details them (SC, Q). Occupation pillar should not be the only pillar (e.g. EQF, &#x2026;)
</li>
<li>currently, information exchange in EURES is only based on ISCO, so even only occupations would help a lot already. Phased approach, first OCC, then SC, &#x2026; ? 
</li>
<li>conclusion: mapping occupations is good, but mapping of skills, tasks and other international standards would be required too. Do not isolate the mapping to the occupation pillar
</li>
</ul>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-sec-2-6" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-2-6"><span class="section-number-3">2.6</span> tasks</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-2-6">
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Martin: the difference between skills/competences and tasks might not be that big. Can we get some examples per type of concept to understand the difference?
</li>
<li>Task in esco: something that is executed by one person in a job, skills/competence: able to perform a certain type of task
</li>
<li>in dutch and rome: competences are always behavioural (psychological), tasks are on an abstract level, but not job specific (they are occupation specific though), activity in rome = group of tasks (1-3 done at the same time)
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-sec-2-7" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-2-7"><span class="section-number-3">2.7</span> ISCO</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-2-7">
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>there was an impression that ISCO would be abandoned in ESCO v1. This is not true, the hierarchy is no longer equal to ISCO, but mapping to ISCO will remain
</li>
<li>reason: if we want to use the occupation hierarchy to drill down, you would need expert knowledge of ISCO
</li>

<h2 id="sec-3"><span class="section-number-2">3</span> automatic mapping</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-3">
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>can we open the automatic mapping algorithm to the PES?
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-sec-4" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-4"><span class="section-number-2">4</span> evaluation grid</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-4">
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>technial machines can be a requirement on the jobmarket (not just the provider, the actual machine and version of the software). However, this means we need enough cases to be realistic and the PES need to have the right vacancies (the employers actually make them). With the sectors we have now, we will not encounter that (will encounter that only with large production domains)
</li>
<li>we only have hospi , agri and vet, SO we will not cover all sectors and problem areas (see last point above). Our conclusions cannot be too optimistic!
</li>
<li>ROME has a description of the specific tools that are used. However, it was a problem to be as specific as possible but as broadly applicable as possible.
</li>
<li>ESCO should not be a CV-JV matching tool, it should be a vocabulary, we need to see whether we can capture the information in the PES scenarios.
</li>
<li>Mapping pilot should be an iterative process: in the first two months we should limit the scope to the mapping. Then we can switch to matching (possibly) and improve the mapping later.
</li>
<li>evaluation grid for JVS encoding: how will it be filled in? <i>Numbers of concepts</i> first in non-structured, PES concepts, so PES to fill the first two columns. Problem Martin has: there is a difference in level of detail between the codings (and the raw data).
</li>
<li>[TODO] Work for the PES: take the documents provided. TF translates them, PES codes them in their system, TF extracts the concepts and the numbers.
</li>
<li>Structured information (pure text) delivered to PES, they will treat it as they treat any case in their system, all of this information will be sent back to ESCO (may be more than we can handle). This means we will get 4 different vacancies, one for every PES, each in the representation that is used by the PES.
</li>
<li>if its a JV, employer decides what is in there
</li>
<li>if it is a CV, the client decides what is in there, furthermore, there is information in the client file. It is not allowed to exchange all information here (by law). If there is such information, we should indicate the information that was not shared. 
</li>
<li>during matching at VDAB, the only information that is shared is job related. Automatic matching plays very safe and never uses that information. E.g. it does not even use the desired job, if they want it they need to give a written approval. At that point it is a service and is no longer automatic. 
</li>
<li>how the information in the JSS and JVS will be used is a step too far.
</li>
<li>evaluated items are very much related to how ESCO is thinking about this. E.g. salary and labour contracts are not there. Maybe working environments should be more developed? Martin notes that ESCO does not aim to capture this information. 
</li>
<li>Dutch PES only codes occupations, the skills are free text. So from the CV the skills will be listed in the free text but 0 skills will be coded from the PES.
